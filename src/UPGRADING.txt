== UPGRADING ==
Upgrading wxBanker to a new version is very easy. The most important
part is ensuring your bank.db file, which holds all of your accounts
and transactions, is in the right place. If you are upgrading from
version 0.4 or later, this is handled automatically for you. If not,
move it manually by either:

*) On Linux/OSX, move bank.db to ~/.local/share/wxbanker/bank.db, creating
   any folders as necessary. This is the recommended approach and will
   save you from needing to move it again in future releases.
   
 OR

*) Copy the bank.db file from the old release into the new release
   folder. Then run wxbanker.py from the new release. Be sure to
   update any shortcuts you may have created to reflect the new
   location. It is safe to delete the old directory if you like.


Thanks for using wxBanker. If you have any problems, questions, or
